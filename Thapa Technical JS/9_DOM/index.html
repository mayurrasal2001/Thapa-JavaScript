    <p class="mayur2">When defining an event handler as an HTML attribute, the attribute
        value should be a string of JavaScript code. That code should be the
        body of the event handler function, not a complete function declaration.
        That is, your HTML event handler code should not be surrounded by
        curly braces and prefixed with the function keyword.</p>

    <p id="myid">
        The event argument means that your handler code can refer to the
        current event object as event. The with statements mean that the
        code of your handler can refer to the properties of the target object, the
        containing <form> (if any), and the containing Document object
        directly, as if they were variables in scope. The with statement is
        forbidden in strict mode (ยง5.6.3), but JavaScript code in HTML
        attributes is never strict. Event handlers defined in this way are
        executed in an environment in which unexpected variables are defined.
        This can be a source of confusing bugs and is a good reason to avoid
        writing event handlers in HTML.
